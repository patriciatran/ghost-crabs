# Atlantic ghost crab burrows distribution and activity on NannyGoat Beach, Sapelo Island, GA
## Patricia Tran

The aim of our study was to investigate beach habitat use by ghost crabs across the dunes and beach habitats of a protected beach, Nanny Goat Beach, as it relates to relationship with the tidal line, and how it might have changed in face of dynamic beach morphology. We aimed to characterize the fine scale distribution, patterns and activities of ghost crab in a protected environment, to gain insight about natural and optimal habitats. To answer this question, we performed a fine scale survey of ghost crab burrows distribution, size, activity, and opening orientation in relation to the tideline along the beach. Using statistical analyses and geographic information systems, we aim to described whether habitat use differs among these habitats and if these can be linked to geomorphological features of the landscape
