## Ghost Crab Burrows

Ghost crab burrows were sampled on Nanny Goat Beach from October 21 to October 24, 2018 during the Sapelo Field Course 2018. Transects perpendicular to the tide line, from the tide line to the edge of the dunes/backdunes transition, were done every 2 meter from the Pavillon to the very south of the Beach, where the creeks enters the marsh.


```{r}
data <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/Ghost Crabs Sapelo/all-burrows-2018.csv", header=TRUE)

summary(data)
# We can see there were 259 burrows on the beach, and 264 burrows on the sand.

# Relationship between Width and Height of the burrows, coloured by environment
plot(data$Height ~ data$Width, col=data$Environment, xlab="Width (mm)", 
     ylab="Height (mm)", main="Correlation between Height and Width of Burrows")

cor(data$Height, data$Width)
linearMod <- lm(Height ~ Width, data=data)
(linearMod)
summary(linearMod)
# Calculate the area of the burrows: formula for the area of an oval: PI x (height/2) x (width/2)


data$Area <- as.numeric(pi*(data$Height/2)*(data$Width/2))

hist(data$Area, xlab="Area of burrows (mm2)", main="Histogram of Area")

#The majority of burrows are "small" 
Dunes <- subset(data, data$Environment=="Dunes")
Beach <- subset(data, data$Environment=="Beach")

hist(Beach$Area, ylim=c(0,100),xlim=c(0,5000), main="A. BURROWS", xlab="Size (area) of the burrow (mm2)")
hist(Dunes$Area, ylim=c(0,100), xlim=c(0,5000), main="B. DUNES", xlab="Size (area) of the burrow (mm2)")


# Is the data normally distributed?
shapiro.test(Dunes$Area)
shapiro.test(Beach$Area)

qqnorm(Dunes$Area); qqline(Dunes$Area, col=2)
qqnorm(Beach$Area); qqline(Beach$Area, col=2)

# Summarize
summary(Dunes$Area)
summary(Beach$Area)

# Compare the normal distribtion using a standard two-sided z test
library(BSDA)
z.test(Dunes$Area, sigma.x=0.5, y=Beach$Area, sigma.y=0.5, mu=2)

# Plot Area vs Environments
#boxplot(data$Area ~ data$Environment, xlab="Environment", ylab="Area of each burrow (mm2)", main="Area of burrows by environment type")

# with ggplot

library(ggplot2)
library(ggsignif)

ggplot(data, aes(x=Environment, y=Area)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_signif(comparisons = list(c("Beach", "Dunes")), 
              map_signif_level=TRUE)+
  ggtitle("C.")+
  theme_classic()


p <- ggplot(data, aes(x=Environment, y=Area)) + 
    geom_violin(trim=FALSE) +
  geom_signif(comparisons = list(c("Beach", "Dunes")), 
              map_signif_level=TRUE)

p


# Measure the variance in the beach and dunes data
range(Beach$Area)
range(Dunes$Area)

data_summary <- function(x) {
   m <- mean(x)
   ymin <- m-sd(x)
   ymax <- m+sd(x)
   return(c(y=m,ymin=ymin,ymax=ymax))
}

p + stat_summary(fun.data=data_summary)

```

## Activity Levels
We used an activity scale to determine if the burrow were active or not. 0= Burrow hole not clear; 1= Clear burrow hole but not traces or sand kickback; 2= Clear hole plus 1 indicator (traces or kickback), 3= Very clear hole AND clear presence of traces and/or kickback

```{r}
# Plot activity by environment
data$Activity <- as.vector(data$Activity)
# Grouped Bar Plot
counts.of.activity <- table(data$Environment, data$Activity)
barplot(counts.of.activity, ylab=c(0,150), main="Activity level by environment type",
  xlab="Activity Level Scale", col=c("Red","Yellow"),
 	legend = rownames(counts.of.activity), beside=TRUE)

#ANOVA
res.aov <- aov(Activity ~ Environment, data = data)
# Summary of the analysis
summary(res.aov)

## Ok there is a significant difference between the activity levels between the beach and dunes, but how can I test if there is a significant different *within* each activity level scale, between the two environments?

```

## Orientation of the burrows between Dunes and Beaches
We hypothesize that on the beach, the burrows would be away from the tidal lines, wherease on the dunes it doesn't matter.

```{r}
data$Direction <- as.vector(data$Direction)
# Grouped Bar Plot
counts.of.orientation <- table(data$Environment, data$Direction)
barplot(counts.of.orientation, ylim = c(0,150), main="Orientation of the burrows by environment type",
  xlab="Burrow orientation compared to tidal line", col=c("Red","Yellow"),
 	legend = rownames(counts.of.orientation), beside=TRUE)





```

## Map of Nanny Goat Beach with samples
```{r}

plot(data$Lat.DMS ~ data$Lon.DMS, col=data$Environment, cex=0.5)
# red dots are Dunes, black are beach

```

Let's try to plot this into a 3D plot:
```{r}
library(scatterplot3d)

s3d <- scatterplot3d(x = data$Lon.DMS, 
                     y = data$Lat.DMS, 
                     z = data$Elevation,
                     cex.symbols=0.5,
                     color=c(data$Environment),
                     xlab="Longitude",
                     ylab="Latitude",
                     zlab="Elevation(m)",
                     angle = 85)
# Here the black = Beach and Red = Dunes
```



From here on, I move into ArcGIS to do the analysis of the points.

## Point Density Analysis

To do this, I go under Analysis, then Analyse Patterns, then Calculate Density. From this, we see that there is a high density towards the southern tip of the beach, between the second and last runnels, and before reaching the dunes. 
```{r Map, out.width=500, out.height=500}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("/Users/patriciatran/Desktop/GIS-clustering-ghost-crabs.png")
```

## Nearest neighbor analysis
GIS, import data, trace a tideline (create new tide feature), use the Tool Near Point to Line
```{r}
gis.data <- read.csv("ghost-crab-GIS-analysis.csv")
plot(gis.data$Oval_Area_mm2~gis.data$Dist_near_tideline, col=gis.data$Environment,
     xlab="Distance to tideline (m)",
     ylab="Size of the burrow opening (mm2)")
# Ok so clearly no relatioship between distance to shoreline and size of the burrows


cor(x=gis.data$Dist_near_tideline, gis.data$Oval_Area_mm2)
linearMod.disttide.area <- lm(Oval_Area_mm2 ~ Dist_near_tideline, data=gis.data)
(linearMod.disttide.area)
summary(linearMod.disttide.area)


```

## Distance between burrows
Are the burrows in the dunes or on the shore closer to each other?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggsignif)

ggplot(gis.data, aes(x=Environment, y=Dist_near_burrow)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_signif(comparisons = list(c("Beach", "Dunes")), 
              map_signif_level=TRUE)+
  ylab("Distance to nearest burrow(m)")+
  xlab("Environment")+
  theme_classic()


```

## Additional figures
Weather data
```{r}
weather <- read.csv("~/Documents/GitHub/ghost-crabs/Data/NOAA-Sapelo-Weather.tsv", sep="\t")
# Get daily averages:
daily_weather <- aggregate(weather[, 3:ncol(weather)], list(weather$DD), mean)

plot(daily_weather$WDIR ~ daily_weather$Group.1, xlab="Day (October)", ylab="Wind direction")

```
